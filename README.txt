This is a front-end technical challenge I was requested to complete as part of a company's recruitment process.

The final result can be seen by simply opening index.html.

The main challenge was to segment the background into 2 differently-coloured triangles with their intersecting line forming a perfect diagonal across a container. This was to be achieved without any images and using jQuery only and was to be fully responsive for all browser window dimensions.

After this the main challenge was to make the screen layout and UI elements match closely to the supplied design image. This includes implementing the 'password view' toggle button so it appears within the password field and this consistently cross-browser.
